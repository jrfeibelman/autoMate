⚡ Building applications for AI automation and productivity tooling ⚡

## 🚨Notice as of 11/7/23

This `autoMate` repository is very much a work in progress and is (initially) designed as a AI/ML playground for experimentation

## 🧐 What is this? 💁 :
Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a revolutionary technology with the potential to change the way users interact with their devices, applications, and data.
`automate` aims to explore applications in LLMs to assess how AI might alter tha HCI paradigm and how individuals might use technology in the future

This library aims to develop AI tools to enhance its user's productivity and user experience. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering**

**💬 Chatbots**

**🤖 Agents**

**🧠 Memory**

**🧐 Evaluation**

## 🔧Setup 
`pip install --upgrade pip` 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
`pip install -e .` 
`python create_load_environment.py` 
Add your API keys to load_environment.env
